Welcome to the PCOS Diagnosis and Treatment Recommendation System! This application provides a preliminary assessment of the risk of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) based on user input. It is designed to help users gain awareness of potential PCOS symptoms and encourage follow-up with a healthcare professional.

## 🌐 Access the App
You can access the app through this [link](https://pcos-detection.streamlit.app/).

## 📋 About the Application
This application is developed using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), making it interactive and easy to use. Users input information about their symptoms, and the system provides a percentage-based risk assessment for PCOS. While it is not a substitute for professional medical advice, it may help users identify symptoms worth discussing with a healthcare provider.

### Note

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Users provide their age, BMI, number of menstrual cycles per year, and other symptoms such as acne, excessive hair growth, weight gain, and male-pattern balding.

3. Additional information on lifestyle changes and potential medical tests is provided for users at higher risk.
